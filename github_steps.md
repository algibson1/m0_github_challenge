# GitHub Steps

Describe in your own words how to establish a connection between a local repository and a remote repository on GitHub.

To connect a local repository to a remote repository, you need a connection key (either https or ssh) from the remote repository. 

You will need to run the command in the terminal of the local repository "git remote add origin" followed by this key to establish the connection.
